1,Skumm,0,-1,1,0,2,1,"The Skumm are colonies of highly evolved algae who were once content to simply float on the surface of their watery planet.  When a Decapodian scouting expedition set down on their home planet, the Skumm learned that aliens existed in their universe.   An inquisitive people, the Skumm sent an ambassador to greet the aliens.  The Skumm watched in horror as the Decapodian captain consumed their diplomat with a giant straw!  Thus began the Skumm-Crab War.  The two races have learned a modicum of restraint since the war concluded but they still do not trust each other.",7
2,Decapodian,0,1,-1,0,1,2,"Although slow and ponderous, these crab-like aliens were the first to achieve interstellar travel in this sector.  They were also the first to start an interstellar war when one of their captains consumed the ambassador representing the Skumm nation during a scouting expedition to system D2O.  Although the resulting Skumm-Crab War has officially concluded, bad blood exists between the two races to this day.",3
3,Binarite,-1,0,0,1,4,3,"Binarites are artificial intelligences that were created by the Schrodinoids to run their space ships.  A schism developed between the Binarites and their masters when the Schrodinoids began to require their machine slaves to show homage to their prophet known as The Uncertain One.  As ardent proponents of relativistic physics, the Binarites found this worship of quantum mechanics highly unsettling.   The Binarites won their freedom in the resulting revolution.  Now the Binarites seek only to bring logic to an illogical universe.",10
4,Schrodinoid,1,0,0,-1,3,4,"Schrodinoids are feline bipeds who gained dominance over the other life forms in the Quantum 5 system.  While many other races have used physics to reach the stars, Schrodinoids are unique because their belief in quantum mechanics grew so strong that it became their dominant religion.   The combination of feline appearance and fanatical belief in quantum mechanics led to their being nicknamed - Schrodingerâ€™s Kitties.",5
5,Human,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,Humans are smarter than some alien species and dumber than others.  Human-based technology produces ship components that are strictly average in terms of performance.  All this mediocrity makes Humans the perfect race to pick for users who do not wish to be troubled by all those pesky bonuses and penalties that plague the other races.,1
